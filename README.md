# scheme

Scheme is a small neural networks library written **purely** in NumPy for educational purpose. It's written with readability in mind.
Why the name scheme? I like the concept of scheme from Algebraic Geometry that's why. 

Current models implemented:
- Simple layer neural network architecture
- Convolutional neural network 

To do:
- LSTM
- RNN
- Autoencoders 
- Generative Adversial Networks
