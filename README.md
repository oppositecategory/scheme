# scheme

Scheme is a tiny neural networks library I wrote for educational purposes while building intuition for hyperparameters. 

It's capable to build and train a n-layer neural network with given number of neurons for each input. 
It includes as of now classical gradient descent, Momentum and RMSprop. I intend to update it with other improvements as dropout, Batch Normalization and etc.
